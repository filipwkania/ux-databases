# Tech Zoo
UX Design and Databases student project

Short project description:
Our client is a company organizing tech-related events in Copenhagen on a regular basis. The company is both focused on attracting participants to these events, as well as on finding partners that are willing to sponsor the events or hold a presentation for an event.

At the moment, our client company only uses Facebook events to reach their audience, but they realized that they need an independent web application where they can manage these events. Create a prototype, with a fully-designed interface, that will work as a proof of concept for our client.
